where you are getting this
shall I take this as a good sign
that put a lot of heat on You
its just got complicated
you have just got involved with the wrong people, choices have concequences
was it worth it , compromising yourself for whatever you have done
what did you have to do to setup that score
hideously scarred
boy scout
do I know it for fact, I just telling you that's all 
This place is a mausoleum
In the joint , I couldn't get the structured idea

Yes when I was lived the lazy life, I now pity that
men fear things they cannot see
More than the fear of your one time scolding I fear the time I waste without knowing what I am doing (proedd)
Purged your fear
I am asking all these things now so that later you will not ask why you didn't tell these from the beginning itself
apathy
figure out the legal ramifications
liquidate the majority of sharing
I have been all through that
Blessed again with bat
idealist
yes he has confirmed for the meeting
I am sure that I cannot stop big machine, too many wheels turning we are going public
I own the muscle in this town
somone's been burning the candle at both ends
which means i should be start looking at the bottom of the river
this is the most irregular
you re welcome to explain the situation
scrambling over the rooftops
the apple is fallen very far from the tree
antics 
cynical man
pinnacle of decadence

Constantly evolving, better yourself
always say thank you if someone praises you
marry the cient's mind- steal their experience, steal their personality for me to be better , and that love story between us should be good, he has to deeply fall in love with me
CREATIVE Nature come for ISOLATION , NATURE and SACRIFICE
I am not really happy with what I achieved today, I have lots to do, lots more to do and that drive is important, that insecurity creates that drive, that desire, and if that dies I die as an actor
belittiling something
if one person does it its going to be a domino effect
being physically naked is not that hard, but being emotionally naked is more hard
